# MVP Scope Definition

**Purpose:**  
This document defines the exact scope of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  
Its goal is to clearly state what is **included** and **explicitly excluded** from version 1 in order to ensure fast, focused, and low-risk execution.

---

## 1. MVP Goal
The goal of the MVP is to validate one core assumption:

> Can everyday people successfully generate income by referring products through a trust-based, lifetime attribution model?

The MVP is not designed to optimize scale, automation, or operational efficiency. It is designed to validate behavior and economics.

---

### 2.1 User Roles
- Ambassador (referrer)
- Customer
- Platform Admin

---

### 2.2 Core Functionalities

#### A. User & Role Management
- User registration and login
- Role assignment at registration
- Basic profile management

---

#### B. Ambassador Referral System
- Unique referral link or referral code per Ambassador
- Permanent attribution of referred customers to an Ambassador
- Ability to track referred customers (basic list view)

---

#### C. Product Catalog

- Basic product attributes (name, description, price, images)
- Product visibility for all users

---

#### D. Order & Purchase Flow

---

#### E. Commission & Earnings Tracking

#### F. Admin Panel
- Manage users
- Manage products

---

## 3. Out of Scope (Explicitly EXCLUDED from MVP)

The following features are intentionally excluded from the MVP, even if they seem important:

### 3.1 Financial & Payout Automation
- Automatic payouts
- Wallet balance withdrawals
- Bank integrations

---

### 3.2 Advanced Marketing & Growth Tools

## 4. Success Criteria for MVP
The MVP will be considered successful if:

- Ambassadors can onboard without assistance
- At least one complete referral-to-purchase flow is completed
- Lifetime attribution functions correctly
- Commissions are calculated accurately
- Manual operations can support early usage

---

## 5. Guiding Principle
If a feature is not required to validate the core referral and lifetime revenue model, it does **not** belong in the MVP.
